1.     Learned Java Programming Language and Advanced Java (Java E2E) from Sun Education Systems in 2006

2.     Completed one year Diploma in Software Engineering (course including C#, .Net, SQL etc.) from NIIT during 2008-09.

3.    Helped / learned fetching data from various sensors and sending that to cloud in Internet Of Things (IoT).

4.    Completed the following online courses on Cognitive Class by IBM:-

     (a)  Python for Data Science
     (b)  Data Analysis with Python
     (c)  Machine Learning with Python

5.    Learning and practicing different Machine Learning Concepts from last 01 Year.

6.    Hands on with different ML concepts Supervised, Un-supervised and Reinforcement Learning using jupyter notebook,  Google Colab and various libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensor Flow etc.

7.    Visit my Github repository  github.com/sabiinsearch

Keen to learn various logics used in Machine Learning and find solutions for different problems like Image recognition, Text classification, Sentiment Analysis using Deep Neural Networks (Convolution Neural Network etc). Have inclination towards the topic.

##Install the Kaggle API which we will use in conjunction with our kaggle.json file to import the data directly to the environment.

######!pip install kaggle

The next line uses a built-in Colab file tool which allow us to upload “kaggle.json” to the notebook. Simply execute the following command and use the button that appears to upload the file.

from google.colab import files
files.upload()

The Kaggle API needs that file to be in a specific location for the authentication process. Just trust me on this one. Execute this command to create the directory and place the file.

# **Machine Learning** #

 Machine Learning (ML) is a sub part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is further studied in three types

1.  _Supervised learning_
2.  _Un-Supervised learning_
3.  _Reinforcement learning_

For futher examples please visit the above **_Practice_** folder

## 1.     **Supervised Learning**

## 2.     **Un-Supervised Learning**

#### **Note -**
while **prediction** , _input = initial input of the model_

if input is numpy array, then we can use
##### numpy.resize(a, new_shape) {_where a = old array_}

## 3.     **Reinforcement learning** ##

  There are many ways for Reinforcement learning like using **_Q function_**  and **_V function_**. Further, to understand **Q-Learning** visit https://youtu.be/LzaWrmKL1Z4 and learn about **Deep Q-learn (DQN)** visit https://youtu.be/OYhFoMySoVs

  ## **Computer Vision** ##
  It is the ability to see and perceive the world comes naturally to us humans. And there are some common challenges data scientists face when transitioning into computer vision. There is a library **OpenCV**. With the help of this librar there are various operations which are handled very easily.

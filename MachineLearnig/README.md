# **Machine Learning** #

 Machine Learning (ML) is a sub part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is further studied in three types

1.  _Supervised learning_
2.  _Un-Supervised learning_
3.  _Reinforcement learning_

For futher examples please visit the above **_Practice_** folder
## **Reinforcement learning** ##

  There are many ways for Reinforcement learning like using **_Q function_**  and **_V function_**. Further, to understand **Q-Learning** visit https://youtu.be/LzaWrmKL1Z4 and learn about **Deep Q-learn (DQN)** visit https://youtu.be/OYhFoMySoVs

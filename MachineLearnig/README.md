# **Machine Learning** #

## Machine Learning (ML) is a sub part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is further studied in three types ##

1.  _Supervised learning_
2.  _Un-Supervised learning_
3.  _Reinforcement learning_

## **Reinforcement learning** ##

  There are many ways for Reinforcement learning like using _Q function_  and _V function_. To understand Q-Learning visit https://youtu.be/LzaWrmKL1Z4 and learn about Deep Q-learn (DQN) visit https://youtu.be/OYhFoMySoVs

# **Machine Learning** #

 Machine Learning (ML) is a sub part of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is further studied in three types

1.  _Supervised learning_
2.  _Un-Supervised learning_
3.  _Reinforcement learning_

For futher examples please visit the above **_Practice_** folder

## 1.     **Supervised Learning**

## 2.     **Un-Supervised Learning**

#### **Note -**
while **prediction** , _input = initial input of the model_

if input is numpy array, then we can use
##### numpy.resize(a, new_shape) {_where a = old array_}

## 3.     **Reinforcement learning** ##

  There are many ways for Reinforcement learning like using **_Q function_**  and **_V function_**. Further, to understand **Q-Learning** visit https://youtu.be/LzaWrmKL1Z4 and learn about **Deep Q-learn (DQN)** visit https://youtu.be/OYhFoMySoVs8

  ### **- Making a custom environment in gym**

  **Gym** is a toolkit for developing and comparing Reinforcement Learning algorithms. It is implemented in Python and R(though the former is primarily used) and can be used to make your code for training RL models short, simple and easy-to-read.

  ### **- Computer Vision** ###
  It is the ability to see and perceive the world comes naturally to us humans. And there are some common challenges data scientists face when transitioning into computer vision. There is a library **OpenCV**. With the help of this librar there are various operations which are handled very easily.

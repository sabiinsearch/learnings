# Chapter 1   -    Arduino

Arduino is a prototype platform (open-source) based on an easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a circuit board, which can be programed (referred to as a microcontroller) and a ready-made software called Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which is used to write and upload the computer code to the physical board.

Arduino provides a standard form factor that breaks the functions of the micro-controller into a more accessible package.
